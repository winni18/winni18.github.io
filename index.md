## About Me


I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at [AAII UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), supervised by [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). 
I am also fortunate to be advised by [A/Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/) at the University of Liverpool.

My research focuses on building intelligent agents that are not only **efficient** but also **trustworthy** in open environments. Specifically, I work on:  
1) Designing **LLM- and RL-based agents** for natural language interaction;  
2) Exploring **value alignment** and **bias mitigation** in language models.

Please feel free to get in touch if our research interests align.
