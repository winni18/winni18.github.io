## About Me


I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at AAII UTS, supervised by [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). 
I have also been fortunate to receive guidance from [Dr. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/), [Dr. Yali Du](https://yalidu.github.io/) and [Dr. Yunqiu Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunqiu-xu-53052ab4/).
 

My research focuses on two key areas: 
- Developing LLM and RL agents for language interaction tasks.
- Value alignment and bias mitigation in language models.
