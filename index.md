## About Me

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) based in University of Technology Sydney (UTS), working under the supervision of [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). 
I received my Master's degree from Shanghai University, and during my doctoral studies, I have also been fortunate to receive guidance from [Dr. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/) and [Dr. Yunqiu Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunqiu-xu-53052ab4/).
 

My research interests center around **natural language processing (NLP)** and **reinforcement learning (RL)**, with a particular focus on the application of large language models in decision-making and machine ethics.
