## About Me


I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at AAII UTS, supervised by [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). 
I have also been fortunate to receive guidance from [A/Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/), [A/Prof. Yali Du](https://yalidu.github.io/).

My research focuses on: 
- Developing **LLM and RL agents** for natural language interaction;
- **Value alignment** and **bias mitigation** in language models.
