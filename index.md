## About Me


I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at [AAII UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), supervised by [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen). 
I am also fortunate to be advised by [A/Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/) at the University of Liverpool.

My research is dedicated to building intelligent agents that are not only efficient but also trustworthy in open and dynamic environments.  
Specifically, my work focuses on:
- Designing **LLM- and RL-based agents** for natural language interaction;  
- Exploring **value alignment** and **bias mitigation** in language models.
